1. You send the bot a word in English.
2. It request the [WooordHunt](https://wooordhunt.ru) service, parses and returns the answer. 
3. If you want, the bot will generate and add an [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) card to your deck.

Decks and cards are NOT stored in the bot's database. You need to run Anki on your server with the [Anki-connect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) plugin installed.
